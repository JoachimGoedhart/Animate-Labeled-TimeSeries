# Animated plot with labels for time-series data

The R script ‘Time-series-gganimate.R’ takes wide data as input from a CSV file. The code is largely based on:
https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/wiki/Temperature-time-series

An example file is included (Data_wide_example_time_single.csv)

* It uses the gganimate package to generate the animation
* The ggrepel package is used  to avoid overlap between the labels.


#### Result of the script
